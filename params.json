{"name":"naim","body":"### The best just got better.\r\n\r\nI know.  It's the same story for all of us.  naim's dead; long live naim.  Mainline naim doesn't support OSCAR; it hasn't been updated in nearly three years ([May 2009](http://naim.n.ml.org/download)).  We all thought the time of naim had come and gone.\r\n\r\nBut here we are -- it's 2012, but everything old is new again.  It's still the same naim that you know and love.  But now, it has the features you expect from a modern CMC client -- scripting support (all the way down to protocol drivers), support for OSCAR, connecting to IRC with passwords that work, and more.  When your irssi-using friends make fun of you for not being able to automatically make rainbow-text in your client, you can tell them to shove it, because now you can too.  When your Pidgin-using friend ask where you've been on AIM, now you can tell them -- the best is back.\r\n","tagline":"naim is a console client for AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), ICQ, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), and The lily CMC.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
